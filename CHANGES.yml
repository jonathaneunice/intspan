        including latest builds of 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and

    version: 1.5.3
    date: June 21, 2016
    notes: >
        Tested and certified for Python 2.7.11, 3.4.4,
        3.5.1, 3.6.0a2, 
        PyPy 3.5.1 (based on Python 2.7.10), and
        PyPy3 5.2.0-alpha0 (based on Python 3.3.5).
        Python 3.2 is deprecated due to its advancing age
        and now-limited compatibility with my test rig.
        It still passes Travis CI tests--but as soon as
        it does not, it will be withdrawn from support.
