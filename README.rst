``intspan`` is a ``set`` subclass that conveniently stores sets of integers.
Sets can be created from and displayed as integer spans such as
``1-3,14,29,92-97`` rather than exhaustive member listings. Compare::

    intspan('1-3,14,29,92-97')
    [1, 2, 3, 14, 29, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97]

Or worse, the unsorted, non-intuitive listings that crop up with Python's
native unordered sets, such as::

    set([96, 1, 2, 3, 97, 14, 93, 92, 29, 94, 95])

While they all indicate the same values, ``intspan`` is more compact. And it
better divulges the contiguous nature of segments of the collection, making it
easier for humans to quickly determine the "shape" of the data and ascertain
"what's missing?"

When iterating, ``pop()``-ing an item, or converting to a list, ``intspan``
behaves as if it were an ordered--in fact, sorted--collection. A key
implication is that, regardless of the order in which items are added,
an ``intspan`` will always be rendered in the most compact, organized
form possible.

The main draw is having a convenient way to specify (possibly discontinuous)
ranges--for example, rows to process in a spreadsheet. It can also help you
quickly identify or report which items were *not* successfully processed in
a large dataset.

There is also an ordered ``intspanlist`` type that helps specify the
ordering of a set of elements.
